# Godot4Net
This is a godot 4.0.2 alpha test project to checkout the new network sync code.
And i started coding interpolation and prediction functionality, not really working atm ;)
Server and client are separated into two projects and its 3D.

Some issues to fix are:
 - spawn initial position
 - bullet actually hitting center of crosshair correctly
 - interpolation rotation
 - prediction
